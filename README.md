# Note Taker Starter Code

Trouble keeping track of your thoughts? Can't seem to remember what you needed to get from yesterday? 

well then give Taker Note a try to keep track of your random thoughts and things to do. 

after opening the program simply do a NPM Installation and connect to the server using NPM start or node server.js

then seemlessly add, edit and delete tasks as you go!
